Universal Programming Techniques homework 6

This project requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to handle its dependencies

To start make sense, I think, the program must contain a mapping class that can create references between groups, subjects, teachers and departments e.g. a class Tutorial that can hold time, group, subject, teacher attributes. But due to the suggested data structure it will create a lot of inconsistency and redundancy. Also, the requirement does not specify such class, only "classes storing extensions" which is quite ambiguous.
